Based on the requirements, here are the core classes, functions, and methods that will be necessary for the web version of new_capella:

1. `CelestialNavigation`: This class will handle the celestial navigation calculations and statistics.

   - `calculate_position`: Method to calculate the position based on celestial observations.
   - `calculate_statistics`: Method to calculate statistics for greater accuracy.

2. `Observation`: This class will represent a single celestial observation.

   - `altitude`: The altitude of the celestial body.
   - `azimuth`: The azimuth of the celestial body.
   - `timestamp`: The timestamp of the observation.

3. `UserInterface`: This class will handle the web user interface.

   - `display_position`: Method to display the calculated position on the UI.
   - `display_statistics`: Method to display the calculated statistics on the UI.
   - `handle_observation`: Method to handle user input of celestial observations.

Now, let's proceed with creating the necessary files and their contents.

1. `celestial_navigation.py`

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class Observation:
    altitude: float
    azimuth: float
    timestamp: str

class CelestialNavigation:
    def calculate_position(self, observations):
        # Perform celestial navigation calculations
        pass

    def calculate_statistics(self, observations):
        # Perform statistical calculations for greater accuracy
        pass
```

2. `user_interface.py`

```python
from celestial_navigation import CelestialNavigation, Observation

class UserInterface:
    def __init__(self):
        self.navigation = CelestialNavigation()

    def display_position(self, position):
        # Display the calculated position on the web UI
        pass

    def display_statistics(self, statistics):
        # Display the calculated statistics on the web UI
        pass

    def handle_observation(self, observation_data):
        # Parse the observation data and create an Observation object
        observation = Observation(
            altitude=observation_data['altitude'],
            azimuth=observation_data['azimuth'],
            timestamp=observation_data['timestamp']
        )

        # Perform celestial navigation calculations
        position = self.navigation.calculate_position([observation])

        # Perform statistical calculations for greater accuracy
        statistics = self.navigation.calculate_statistics([observation])

        # Display the results on the web UI
        self.display_position(position)
        self.display_statistics(statistics)
```

3. `app.py`

```python
from user_interface import UserInterface

# Create an instance of the UserInterface class
ui = UserInterface()

# Example observation data
observation_data = {
    'altitude': 45.0,
    'azimuth': 180.0,
    'timestamp': '2022-01-01 12:00:00'
}

# Handle the observation
ui.handle_observation(observation_data)
```

This is a basic structure for the web version of new_capella. Additional files and code may be required depending on the specific requirements and framework used for the web application.
